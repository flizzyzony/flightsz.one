      Anyone claiming my alias is not me man not even I would want to claim this curse of an alias I might still be around in a sense but I won't be out here telling you hey yeah I'm that nigga flights like every single bad thing to have happened online is relating to that one alias I don't want to be running from feds forever like I'm Pablo Escobar or some shit I haven't even done anything crazy yet a lot of you retards love hyping my name up way more than it should be because you don't quite understand what I've done and just assume I'm some demon mother fucker when in reality none of it was anything noteworthy, atleast I don't and never saw it as anything to be proud of if I could just undo this alias from ever existing in the first place I would but since I don't see my name dying out any time soon I don't know pretty much everything relating to me will be sold be that my domains, usernames, etc, truth is I probably wont actually quit this internet hellhole for a while due to my situations, if I've spoke to you about it then you know, if not it probably isn't of your concern, if I like you I've probably made it clear to you by now and same for vice versa, some of you are cool but you really aren't going anywhere in life and I don't want to be around it anymore as it keeps landing me in more trouble than the last time kk bye guys if you wanna contact me no you dont
