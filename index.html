        <p class="display-text" id="head">As of today, 28th July 2024, any new accounts claiming to be "flights" are most likely not me. If you would really like to confirm, you can contact me on Snapchat (@swappers). I will still be active for a short while as I am unsure how everything is about to go (read below), but expect me to go inactive once I do figure this all out.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="display-text">Being around "com" and other equally toxic communities since I was 11, so for around 6 years, has led me to making countless decisions which I'd later regret, and a concerning amount of slip-ups and overconfidence leading to the situation I've found myself in now. I've said for the past 3 or so years that I've just left too many traces, I'll eventually get doxed, it was no longer a matter of "Will I get doxed?" but rather "When will I get doxed?", and with it finally happening at arguably the worst time it could have possibly happened, what's the most logical decision to make? Even with me being doxed by multiple people, and the current legal situation I'm in, more people continue to try dox me and tip the police more information on me to further my case.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="display-text">With me being on the internet for 10+ years, I have made many mistakes and took actions I'd now say are stupid, so to anyone I may have wronged in the past I apologise. If we have "beef", no we don't. Whether or not this legal situation goes well for me (it isn't looking too bad), the best choice is to leave all of this behind, as for the most part, I have done far worse than I have good online. No matter what I do, it almost always ends up destructive, with me ending up on the news 2 years ago for things I'd now question the morality of, and multiple people being doxed or "harmed" in other ways for reasons we could've easily avoided. I've been in these spaces for far too long, I've overstayed my welcome.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="display-text">Trust nobody; the same people who I spent years gaining knowledge with, making money with, dating back as far as 2019, are the same people deciding to snake me now.</p>
        <p class="display-text">I won't say names,  nor will I do anything to get back at them, though they may go around flexing it to boost their ego,  I don't care. If it doesn't happen now, it'll just happen later.</p>
        <p class="display-text">Alhamdulillah for everything, for those I have built up great things with over these years, I love you all.</p>
