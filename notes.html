        <p class="display-text">Salutations, hackers! I'm not completely gone, I will still have accounts on most apps on different names, I just don't want to be affiliated with the name "flights" as heavily anymore for obvious reasons. If you do not already have these accounts, you can contact me on Snapchat (@swappers), and I'll give you them, if we do not frequently talk, have something in common we both have interest in, or work together on certain projects, the chances I'll give you them are lower; it isn't personal, I just don't want to associate with as many people who know me as "flights". If we have been close and you need anything from me, you can still contact me for any assistance, I will likely give away all of the source codes I have written over the past 4 years, as most of them no longer have any value to me. Trust nobody and take your time, looks like we have to make something out of life right?</p>
